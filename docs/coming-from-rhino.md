# Coming from Rhino

If you know Rhino, you'll feel at home — same command-line workflow, same
aliases, same object snaps, and it imports your Rhino shortcuts. Not every
command is here yet, but the ones that are work the way you'd expect. This
page maps your habits over and is honest about the gaps.

## What's the same

- **The command line.** Type a command, answer its prompts, click points or
  type coordinates (`10,5,0`, relative `@5,0,0`, polar `10<45`). ++tab++
  completes, ++enter++ or ++space++ repeats the last command, and
  ++space++ is Enter everywhere it is in Rhino.
- **The mouse.** Right-drag orbits, ++shift++ pans, ++ctrl++ zooms, and a
  right-click is Enter.
- **Aliases.** `l`, `pl`, `c`, `m`, `co`, `mi`, `o`, `f`, … work as you'd
  expect, and you can import your own (below).
- **Command options.** The words in a prompt's parentheses are choices, as
  in Rhino: `arc` offers *Center* and *StartEnd*, `circle` offers *2Point*,
  *3Point* and *Diameter*, `rectangle` *Center* and *3Point*, `line`
  *BothSides*, `box` *Center*, `sphere` *2Point*. Type the word (a prefix
  is enough) or click its chip beside the command line.
- **Object snaps** — end, mid, cen, quad, int, perp, near — on a persistent
  osnap bar, plus a construction plane (`cplane`).
- **++tab++ direction lock.** Aim, press ++tab++ to freeze that direction,
  type the distance. Object snaps keep working while it's held. The lock
  releases on ++tab++ again or at the next point.
- **++ctrl++-click elevator.** Click a point on the construction plane with
  ++ctrl++ held to stand a vertical up from it, then set the height with the
  mouse or by typing it — the way you place a point off the CPlane in Rhino.
- **Maximised viewports.** ++ctrl+m++, or a double-click on a viewport's
  title, gives the pane you're in the whole window and puts your layout back
  on the second press. `max` does it from the command line.
- **The gumball** for move / rotate / scale, with numeric entry and Alt-drag
  copy; ++ctrl+shift++-click faces and edges for push/pull and fillets.
  `GumballAlignment`, or the small tag beside the gumball, chooses CPlane,
  Object, World or View. Object follows a line, a planar curve or surface,
  text, a hatch or a picture; solids and selections of several objects use
  the CPlane. View follows the current viewport's view plane.
- **Layers**, display modes (`wireframe` / `shaded` / `ghosted` / `rendered`
  / `technical`), and **linetypes** per layer or object.
- **Surface isocurves and edges are yours to switch off**, as they are in
  Rhino's display mode settings. Each mode starts where you'd expect
  (rendered has isocurves off), and the **Display** panel, beside Properties
  and Layers, overrides that for the pane you're in. `isocurves` and
  `surfaceedges` do the same from the command line.
- **Two-space drafting** — model space plus paper-space **layouts** with
  detail views, associative dimensions and hidden-line output. See
  [Make a drawing sheet](howto/drawings.md).
- **Interchange** — reads and writes `.3dm` for Rhino 5–8 (curves stay exact
  NURBS; surfaces write as meshes — use STEP for an exact surface round
  trip), STEP, and more. See [File formats](reference/file-formats.md).

## Bring your Rhino settings over

In Rhino, export your aliases (*Options → Aliases → Export*) to a text file,
then in Serpentine3D:

- **Settings → Aliases** → import that file. Known Rhino commands are mapped
  to their Serpentine equivalents automatically; simple macros
  (`'_Zoom _Extents`, `-Osnap _Mid _Toggle`) are translated too.
- **Settings → Keyboard** → import a keybindings list (`F5 zoomextents` per
  line, or JSON) and bind any key to any command.

## Command map (a sample)

Most Rhino command names and aliases resolve directly. A few worth knowing:

| Rhino | Serpentine3D |
|---|---|
| `Line` `Polyline` `Curve` `InterpCrv` | `line` `polyline` `curve` `interpcrv` |
| `Circle` `Arc` `Rectangle` | `circle` `arc` `rectangle` |
| `InsertKnot` `RemoveKnot` `InsertControlPoint` | `insertknot` `removeknot` `insertcontrolpoint` |
| `Dir` `Flip` | `dir` `flip` |
| `ExtrudeCrv` `Revolve` `Loft` `Sweep1/2` | `extrude` `revolve` `loft` `sweep1` `sweep2` |
| `FilletEdge` `ChamferEdge` `Shell` | `filletedge` `chamferedge` `shell` |
| `BooleanUnion / Difference / Intersection` | `booleanunion` `booleandifference` `booleanintersection` |
| `Move` `Copy` `Rotate` `Scale` `Mirror` `Array` | `move` `copy` `rotate` `scale` `mirror` `array` |
| `Trim` `Split` `Join` `Explode` `Offset` | `trim` `split` `join` `offset` |
| `Layout` `Detail` `Make2D` `Dim` | `layout` `detail` `make2d` `dim` |
| `Zebra` `CurvatureAnalysis` `DraftAngleAnalysis` | `zebra` `curvature` `draftanalysis` |
| `UndoView` `RedoView` `LockOther` | `undoview` `redoview` `lockother` |

The in-app `help` (or ++f1++) opens a searchable
[command reference](reference/commands.md) with every command and its aliases.

## What's different

- **Units** default to millimetres; set them with `units` (mm/cm/m/in/**feet
  & inches**), with an optional model rescale.
- A **right-click** in the viewport is Enter — it runs what you've typed or
  repeats the last command.
- **AI-native**: an [MCP server and in-app assistant](howto/ai-mcp.md) can see
  the viewport and run every command — Rhino has nothing equivalent built in.
- **Headless**: the whole engine [scripts and batches](howto/scripting.md)
  without a GUI.

## Not here yet

Serpentine3D is a young, focused modeller — it does direct NURBS/BREP
modelling and drafting well, but it is **not** a full Rhino replacement.
Notably absent today:

- **Grasshopper** / visual programming (and full history-based parametrics —
  `recordhistory` covers loft/extrude/revolve only).
- **SubD** modelling.
- A production **render engine** (`rendered` is a lit preview, not a raytracer)
  and Rhino's materials/lighting depth.
- The long tail of specialist commands, and the third-party plugin ecosystem.

If a command you rely on is missing, it's probably on the roadmap — the
project tracks requests, so it's worth asking on
[GitHub](https://github.com/chisomobanzi/Serpentine3D).
