"""Sorting translucent objects back to front, once per frame instead of
once per object.

A single object with opacity below 1 puts the whole scene through a
back-to-front sort every frame, so the cave file paid 6583 Python calls a
frame — each building two arrays and taking a norm — to order objects that
had not moved. Profiling put it at about a fifth of a full redraw, in every
viewport.

The distance is now one vectorised subtraction per frame, and the centres
behind it are cached against the mesh they came from, so they survive both
the camera moving and the scene changing around them.

The order itself must not change, which is what the differential test is
for: the old per-object key function is kept here and the two are compared
on awkward input.
