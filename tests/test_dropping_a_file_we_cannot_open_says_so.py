"""Dropping a file Serpentine3D cannot open says so instead of nothing.

Reported as "Drag & Drop does not work for DWGs" (#21): DWG is not a format
the program reads at all, so the drag was refused and the drop never
arrived, leaving the window silent. Silence reads as a broken feature. A
drop of local files is now taken and answered: whatever can be imported is,
and anything that cannot gets a line saying why, naming DXF where the file
is a DWG since that is the way out of it.
