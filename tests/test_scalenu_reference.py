"""`scalenu` by pointing at it, not only by typing three ratios.

Every other scale command lets you grab a reference point and drag it to
where it should end up, and shows you the result while you do. scalenu
asked for three numbers and showed you nothing until it was over — which
is the one scale where the numbers are hardest to work out in your head,
because there are three of them and each is about a different direction.

The two reference points say the same thing per axis: how far the point
started from the base, and how far it should end up. An axis the
reference point does not move along has no reference length, so nothing
about it is being asked, and it is left alone.
