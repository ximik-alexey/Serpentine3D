"""Rhino .3dm import must not be quadratic in a brep's size.

Regression: a 921 MB set-design file (1900 breps, 42k faces, 78k edges, worst
single brep 7921 faces x 12688 edges) never finished importing.
_edges_on_surface tested every face against every edge of the brep — about
1.1 billion surface projections, hours of work — because each face has to
rediscover which edges bound it.

Edges are pruned by bounding box first. That is sound: an edge every sample
of which projects onto the surface within `tol` necessarily lies inside the
surface's bounding box grown by `tol`.
