"""What the draw loop is allowed to do per object, per frame.

A real scene here is 5900 objects — mostly curves — and the viewport drew every
one of them every frame, looking each shader uniform up by name as it went.
That is 26k `glGetUniformLocation` calls a frame before a single pixel is
filled, and a draw call for every object whether or not it is on screen.

These are GL *call counts*, not timings: the cost is the chatter, and counting
it is the same answer on any machine. The budgets below are deliberately loose
— they exist to catch work that scales with the number of objects, not to pin
an exact call sequence.
