"""A solid built from an imported brep faces outward.

Properties showed `Volume: -0.041 mm³` on objects imported from Rhino
files. A negative volume is what OpenCascade reports for a solid whose
faces all point inward, and it is not only a display oddity: outward is
what booleans, offsets and shading all read to tell inside from outside.

It was widespread rather than exotic. Of the openNURBS samples, 58 of the
61 solids in `v5_disk_brake.3dm` came in inverted, 6 of 14 in
`v4_RhinoPhone.3dm`, 4 of 10 in `v5_clip.3dm`, and the single solid in
`v5_ring.3dm`. Faces are rebuilt one at a time and each is oriented on its
own evidence, so a whole sewn shell can come out consistently inside out.
Promoting a shell to a solid is the place that knows, and it was the one
step not checking.
