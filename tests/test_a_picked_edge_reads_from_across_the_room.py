"""A picked edge is drawn wide enough to actually see.

Lourenço reported no feedback when picking edges. The highlight was
there all along — gold, "3 pixels" wide — but it asked glLineWidth for
those pixels, and plenty of drivers cap lines at 1: the pick came back
as one gold hairline over a gold-selected object. The object edges
already solved this with the screen-space quad shader; the highlight
now goes through the same pipeline, gold over a dark halo like the
control-point markers, so it is honest pixels on every driver.
