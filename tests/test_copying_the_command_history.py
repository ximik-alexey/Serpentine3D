"""Text picked out in the command history is what ++ctrl+c++ copies.

You could always drag a selection across the echoed history, and it lit up
like a selection, but nothing would take it. Typing goes to the command
line wherever you clicked, which is what a CAD app should do, so the
history never holds the keyboard focus and never saw the key. ++ctrl+c++
reached the Edit menu's Copy instead, which copies geometry, and with no
object picked it quietly did nothing at all. An error message you can see
but cannot copy is not much use when you are pasting it into a bug report.

Copy now asks the history first and the drawing second, and a selection
left over in the history is dropped the moment you go back to a pane, so
the next ++ctrl+c++ over a picked object copies the object.
