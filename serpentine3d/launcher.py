"""Application entry point.

The whole point of this module is import order. Importing
``serpentine3d.app`` pulls in the OpenCASCADE geometry kernel (~150 MB),
which takes a couple of seconds on a cold start — long enough that the app
appears to hang after launch. So the launcher does the cheap work first
(GL format, QApplication, splash) and only *then* imports the app, so the
splash is on screen during that slow kernel load.

Keep this module free of heavy imports at the top level.
