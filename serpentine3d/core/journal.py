"""The session journal: what was actually done, written down as it happens.

The command history is an echo for people; this is a recipe for machines.
Every value a command receives — the click already resolved through snaps,
the typed number already parsed, the objects a selection answered with —
is appended to a JSONL file together with the plane and aim it was
resolved against, so that core.replay can re-execute the session headless
and land on the same geometry.

Edits that happen outside any command (a gumball drag, a control point
nudged) are caught by watching the scene while the processor is idle.
Not every idle change is an edit, though: a deferred shape converting on
first read swaps geometry without anyone touching it. The discriminator
is the undo checkpoint — every real edit route checkpoints first, so a
change that arrives without one is bookkeeping and only refreshes the
shadow. A change that arrives with one is written as a delta of exact
BREPs, one delta per checkpoint, so undo peels the same layers on replay
that it peeled live.
