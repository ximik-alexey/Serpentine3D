"""Converting a .3dm across several processes (GitHub #3).

A 65259-object file took about fifteen minutes to open on a 22-core machine,
and the machine was almost idle throughout. The cost is not our arithmetic and
not OpenCASCADE: it is rhino3dm's Python binding, where reading one float off
a point costs 11 us and reaching one mesh vertex costs 25 us — against 0.25 us
for a plain attribute and 1.67 us for the equivalent OCCT call. A survey mesh
has millions of vertices, so mesh reading alone is 90% of an import.

That work is Python-side, so it holds the GIL and threads cannot touch it.
Processes can: objects convert independently. Three things make the difference
between a fix and a disappointment, all of them measured:

  * **Fork, don't re-read.** A worker that opens the file itself pays ten
    seconds and a private copy of the model. Forked workers inherit the
    parent's copy-on-write instead — sixteen of them peaked at 0.32 GB each
    against a 0.47 GB parent.

  * **Interleave, don't slice.** A drawing keeps its meshes together, so
    handing each worker a contiguous block of the file gives one of them every
    expensive object: 6.5x collapsed to 1.5x until the batches were strided.

  * **Spawn the reader.** The app cannot fork: its tessellation threads hold
    locks a forked child would inherit already locked and wait on forever. So
    one thread-free process is spawned, and *it* reads the file and forks the
    converters.

  * **Share out the one object nobody else can help with.** Sharing objects
    out means a drawing converts no faster than its dearest single object. A
    survey file ends in two meshes of 6.6 million vertices, fifty seconds
    each, and the last fifty-eight seconds of a seventy-four second import
    were fifteen workers watching one read a mesh. Past SPLIT_VERTICES a mesh
    is read in vertex ranges by the whole pool instead: 74 s to 32 s, and the
    object itself 59.5 s to 6.2 s.

Shapes come back down a pipe. A MeshShape is numpy and pickles as it stands;
a TopoDS_Shape does not pickle at all — it aborts the interpreter — so it
travels as a BinTools archive, about 6 KB and half a millisecond each.

On a 10474-object file this took conversion from 86 s to 8 s.
